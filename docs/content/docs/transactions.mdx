Transactions are the core of Tracktrip. They are the expenses you make during your trip.

## Adding transactions

You need to add them manually while you are traveling. You can do it by clicking on the **Plus** button in the bottom center of the app.

### Fields

A transaction offers several fields for you to track your expense:

* **Name**: a short description of your expense (example: *Restaurant*, *Coffee*, ...)
* **Description**: a longer description of your expense (example: *Lunch with friends*, *Coffee with the team*, ...). This is optional.
* **Amount**: the amount of your expense. Tracktrip supports multiple currencies.
* **Type**: the type of your expense. You can choose between *Food*, *Transport*, *Accommodation*, *Activity*, *Other*. Every type has a different treatment in the app, you can learn more about them [here](/types).
* **Date**: the date of your expense.
