Transactions are the core of Tracktrip. They are the expenses you make during your trip.

## Adding transactions

You need to add them manually while you are traveling. You can do it by clicking on the **Plus** button in the bottom center of the app.

### Fields

A transaction offers several fields for you to track your expense:

* **Name**: a short description of your expense (example: *Restaurant*, *Coffee*, ...)
* **Description**: a longer description of your expense (example: *Lunch with friends*, *Coffee with the team*, ...). This is optional.
* **Amount**: the amount of your expense. Tracktrip supports multiple currencies.
* **Type**: the type of your expense. You can choose between *Food*, *Transport*, *Accommodation*, *Activity*, *Other*. Every type has a different treatment in the app, you can learn more about them [here](/types).
* **Date**: the date of your expense.
* **Who paid**: which traveller paid for this expense. This is useful to compute the balance between travellers.
* **Who was involved**: which travellers were involved in this expense. This is useful to compute the balance between travellers as well.
* **Category**: the category of your expense. This is useful to refine your expense categorization. You can learn more about categories [here](/categories).
* **Place**: the place where you made your expense. This is useful to track your expenses by location if you are traveling to multiple places.

Then, depending on the type of your expense, you will have additional fields to fill in that will be useful to compute your budget.

The transaction will then be added to the list of transactions and will be shared with the other travellers.
