Categories are a way to fine-group your transactions. This is useful if you want to add more details to your analytics. Categories are linked to one expense type.

## Manage categories

You can create categories by clicking on the expense type in the **Analytics** tab. Click on the **Settings** button in the top right corner. You can then create a category by clicking on the **New category** button.

### Delete a category

You can manage your categories in the **Settings** page of an expense type. You can then delete the category by clicking on the **Delete** button in the menu on the right of the category.

## Analytics

You can see the categories at the top and in the chart of the expense type page, accessible in the **Analytics** tab.
