Tracktrip is an application to manage your travel finance.

As a traveller myself, I want to help other travellers to be able to travel as much as they can.
I don't like to develop shiny features that are not useful.
I want my contribution to be honest, transparent and for the greater good.

I don't want to hide under the name of a company or fake the fact that we are tons of employees.
I want to highlight that this is a project by me, for other people like me.
