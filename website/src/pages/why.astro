          On a train from Stockholm to Narvik, I realized I had no idea how much
          I’d spent that week. Receipts were lost, currencies were confusing,
          and my bank app only showed half the picture. I needed a tool built
          for travelers, by a traveler.

          Most budgeting apps are designed for daily life, not for the chaos of
          travel. They don’t account for multiple currencies, shared expenses,
          or the spontaneity of being on the road.

          I developed Tracktrip as a personal project during my travels, using
          it to manage my own expenses across multiple countries. It became an
          essential tool for me, helping me stay on budget and understand my
          spending patterns.

          Now, anyone can use and contribute to the project, making travel
          budgeting easier for everyone.

            👋 I love to travel. I've traveled in Europe for 6 months, and
            that's when I decided to build Tracktrip. I wanted a better way to
            track my expenses and stay on budget while exploring new places.
